        Bigelozidane is the first C++ program that I wrote when I was roughly 16 years old and has now been converted to an Android app. It\'s essentially a simple substitution cipher that takes plain text and encodes it so other people can\'t read it.\n\nAlthough decoding was not a part of the original program, it was my intention to add that functionality at some point. It only took 20+ years. ðŸ˜Ž\n\nImportant Note:\nPlease keep in mind that this is for entertainment purposes only. Don\'t encode any important information because substitution ciphers are easy to crack for experienced cryptographers.
